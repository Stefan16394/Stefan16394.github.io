                        Twitch is a live streaming video platform owned by Twitch Interactive, now a subsidiary of
                        Amazon.com.Introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform,
                        Justin.tv, the site primarily focuses on video gaming, including playthroughs of video games,
                        broadcasts of eSports competitions, creative content, and more recently, music broadcasts.
                        Content on the site can either be viewed live or via video on demand.

                        The popularity of Twitch would eclipse that of its general-interest counterpart; in October 2013,
                        the website had 45 million unique viewers,and by February 2014, it was considered the fourth
                        largest source of peak Internet traffic in the United States. At the same time, Justin.tv's parent
                        company was re-branded as Twitch Interactive to represent the shift in focus â€“ Justin.tv was shut
                        down in August 2014. The site has also branched out into music-related streams and content.
                        In 2015, Twitch announced it had more than 1.5 million broadcasters and 100 million visitors per month
